# deb-s3

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/krobertson/deb-s3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/krobertson/deb-s3)

`deb-s3` is a simple utility to make creating and managing APT repositories on
S3.

Most existing guides on using S3 to host an APT repository have you
using something like [reprepro](http://mirrorer.alioth.debian.org/) to generate
the repository file structure, and then [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd) to
sync the files to S3.

The annoying thing about this process is it requires you to maintain a local
copy of the file tree for regenerating and syncing the next time. Personally,
my process is to use one-off virtual machines with
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), script out the build process, and then would
prefer to just upload the final `.deb` from my Mac.

With `deb-s3`, there is no need for this. `deb-s3` features:

* Downloads the existing package manifest and parses it.
* Updates it with the new package, replacing the existing entry if already
  there or adding a new one if not.
* Uploads the package itself, the Packages manifest, and the Packages.gz
  manifest. It will skip the uploading if the package is already there.
* Updates the Release file with the new hashes and file sizes.

## Getting Started

You can simply install it from rubygems:

```console
$ gem install deb-s3
```

Or to run the code directly, just check out the repo and run Bundler to ensure
all dependencies are installed:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/krobertson/deb-s3.git
$ cd deb-s3
$ bundle install
```

Now to upload a package, simply use:

```console
$ deb-s3 upload --bucket my-bucket my-deb-package-1.0.0_amd64.deb
>> Examining package file my-deb-package-1.0.0_amd64.deb
>> Retrieving existing package manifest
>> Uploading package and new manifests to S3
   -- Transferring pool/m/my/my-deb-package-1.0.0_amd64.deb
   -- Transferring dists/stable/main/binary-amd64/Packages
   -- Transferring dists/stable/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz
   -- Transferring dists/stable/Release
>> Update complete.
```

```

Uploads the given files to a S3 bucket as an APT repository.
```

You can also delete packages from the APT repository. Please keep in mind that
this does NOT delete the .deb file itself, it only removes it from the list of
packages in the specified component, codename and architecture.

Now to delete the package:
```console
$ deb-s3 delete my-deb-package --arch amd64 --bucket my-bucket --versions 1.0.0
>> Retrieving existing manifests
   -- Deleting my-deb-package version 1.0.0
>> Uploading new manifests to S3
   -- Transferring dists/stable/main/binary-amd64/Packages
   -- Transferring dists/stable/main/binary-amd64/Packages.gz
   -- Transferring dists/stable/Release
>> Update complete.
```

```

Remove the package named PACKAGE. If --versions is not specified, deleteall versions of PACKAGE. Otherwise, only the specified versions will be deleted.
```

You can also verify an existing APT repository on S3 using the `verify` command:

```console
deb-s3 verify -b my-bucket
>> Retrieving existing manifests
>> Checking for missing packages in: stable/main i386
>> Checking for missing packages in: stable/main amd64
>> Checking for missing packages in: stable/main all
```

```

  deb-s3 verify
